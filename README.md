The Peoples Ballot

We believe that everyone should have access to information about upcoming elections, in a snappy, intuitive way.

Premise: Input your address in King County, Washington and we will tell you information about which electoral districts you reside in, upcoming elections, the candidates and initiatives on the table. The initial release will be focusing on King County, in Washington State. We would love to scale out the development, but will hold off on making such decisions until the original scope of the project has been achieved.

We are developing this application as a way to learn the basic skills of programming, while providing a public service to the community in King County.

Peoples Ballot will be developed in 3, two week sprints using Scrum. The Back-End will be coded in Python, with the Front-End using HTML, CSS & JS with Bootstrap. We will be pushing our application using Heroku, implementing postgreSQL database to store our information.

If you have any questions or would like to join the cause, feel free to email us at ian.berry@protonmail.com or mlitchev@protonmail.ch
